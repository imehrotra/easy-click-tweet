# Easy Click Tweet
An application that allows the user to share links to pre-written tweets that can be posted

## Purpose
Over the last year, Twitter has become an important communication platform for activist groups.  The tactic of "Twitter Storms" and "Thunderclaps" has led to a trend of several people posting the same thing simultaneously to better flood the Internet with their message.  Currently many groups use websites like Click To Tweet which offers limited functionality and charges money for analytics access.

To better serve activists, I created a web app that outputs a shortened url to the scripted Twitter message that has an attached emoji keyboard.  To use it, just type in your message, hit get link, and copy the outputted url!
